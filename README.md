# GrapheneOS compatibility for Banking Apps
This is an ongoing work-in-progress sub-project that maintains a list of currently tested banking apps that do not enforce [SafetyNet](https://grapheneos.org/articles/attestation-compatibility-guide) and work on [GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org/)'s [supported](https://grapheneos.org/faq#supported-devices) devices using our [Sandboxed Play Services](https://grapheneos.org/usage#sandboxed-google-play).
